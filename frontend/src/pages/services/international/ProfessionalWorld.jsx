Professional web pages are World Wide Web pages created by an individual to contain content of a personal nature rather than on behalf of a company, organization, or institution. Professional web pages are primarily used for informative or entertainment purposes but can also be used for personal career marketing, social networking, or personal expression.

            Remember – It is different and at times more important than your professional career. While a resume gives an overview of your work experience and education, your LinkedIn profile provides a much better overview of your professional identity – both as an employee and as an individual. It also ‘talks’ to relevant people (and recruiters) about your vision and career goals. It is therefore a more holistic overview of the ‘professional’ you.

            A professionally created Social Profile allows you to have a professional and polished online presence that serves as a means to share your skills, education, and career interests with potential employers.
